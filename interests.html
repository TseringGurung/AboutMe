                <h3>Aviation</h3>
                <p>I have a strong passion for aviation and aspire to have a career in the aviation field. I went to Aviation High School where I learned about the field and eventually managed to get my licenses 
                    to work on planes after an annoying process of having to wait for COVID to end. While I was waiting, I focused on college and since I was already in my 3rd year,
                    and so I might as well just get my degree and then focus on Aviation.

                <h3>Gaming</h3>
                <p>Gaming is one of my favorite hobbies. I enjoy playing a variety of genres, but mostly only play valorant or league of legends. I play on my free time, sometimes by myself but mostly with friends. </p>

                <h3>Biking</h3>
                <p>Biking is something I have done since I was a kid and still continue to do. I love travelling throughout the city or sometimes just explore parks that are nearby. Usually I go by myself but there are
                    times where I go with friends. I even commute to school with it so it comes in very handy in saving me money as I don't have to pay for transportation.
                <br><br> The bike I currently use is an <a class = "here" href="https://www.aventon.com/products/pace500-3-step-through-ebike?variant=43302187827395"> Aventon Pace 500</a>
                 which is an electric bike, it has around 4000 miles on it and is about 4 years old.

                <h3>Photography</h3>
                    <p>I recently got into doing photography and it has been fun. I usually take my camera with me on my bike rides and take photos of a variety of things, which include buildings,
                        nature, animals (my dog), people, and much more.
                        <br><br>The camera and lens I use consist of the <a class="here" href="https://electronics.sony.com/imaging/interchangeable-lens-cameras/aps-c/p/ilce6000l-b?srsltid=AfmBOopILr-GGFKgFwCr8-uxf8f1uIKyNVZke_u3S6fEU4jKEuv0BXnN">Sony A6000</a>
