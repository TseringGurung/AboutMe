                <p>Hello my name is Tsering Gurung and I am currently a senior at Hunter College. I major in Computer Science and am eager to learn about Web Development.
                    I have experience in mostly C++ along with some knowledge of Python, CSS/HTML, and JS. My daily life consists of going to the gym early in the morning 
                    and then walking my dog. After that it usually consists of me studying, whether it be for homework, or just learning purposes. And then, I have the rest
                    of the day to whatever comes up. That could consist of going out with family/friends, staying at home and just playing games, or some hobbies/interests which
                    can be found <a class = "here" href="interests.html">here</a>.
